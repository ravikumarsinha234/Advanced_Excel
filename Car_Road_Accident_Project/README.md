# Car Accident Analysis Dashboard

## Overview  
This repository contains an analysis of car accident data using advanced Excel techniques to create interactive dashboards. The dataset used for this project is the **Car Accident Dataset** from Kaggle, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nextmillionaire/car-accident-dataset). The goal of this project is to provide insights into car accident trends, causes, and patterns using data visualization and Excel's powerful features.

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle:  
- **Dataset Name**: Car Accident Dataset  
- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nextmillionaire/car-accident-dataset)  
- **Description**: The dataset contains detailed information about car accidents, including location, time, weather conditions, vehicle types, and more. It provides a comprehensive view of factors contributing to accidents.  

---

## Tools Used  
- **Microsoft Excel**: Advanced Excel techniques were used to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.  
- **Excel Features**:  
  - **Pivot Tables**: For summarizing and aggregating data.  
  - **Charts and Graphs**: For visualizing trends and patterns.  
  - **Conditional Formatting**: To highlight key insights.  
  - **Slicers and Timelines**: For interactive filtering in dashboards.  
  - **Formulas and Functions**: For calculations and data manipulation (e.g., `VLOOKUP`, `IF`, `SUMIFS`).

## Key Features of the Dashboard  
1. **Interactive Filters**:  
   - Use slicers and timelines to filter data by date, location, weather conditions, and more.  
   
2. **Visualizations**:  
   - Bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to display accident trends, causes, and severity.  
   
3. **Key Metrics**:  
   - Total accidents, average severity, most common causes, and accident hotspots.  
   
4. **Dynamic Updates**:  
   - The dashboard updates automatically as filters are applied, providing real-time insights.

## Insights  
The analysis of the car accident dataset revealed several key insights, which are visualized in the interactive Excel dashboard. Below are the highlights:  

1. **Total Casualties by Vehicle Type**:  
   - Breakdown of casualties by different vehicle types (e.g., cars, motorcycles, trucks, buses).  
   - Identification of vehicle types most frequently involved in accidents.  

2. **Fatal Casualties**:  
   - Analysis of accidents resulting in fatalities.  
   - Trends and contributing factors (e.g., speeding, drunk driving, poor road conditions).  

3. **Serious Casualties**:  
   - Examination of accidents causing serious injuries.  
   - Correlation with factors such as weather, road type, and time of day.  

4. **Casualties by Car**:  
   - Focus on accidents involving cars, including passenger vehicles and SUVs.  
   - Insights into common causes and severity levels.  

5. **Casualties by Road Surface**:  
   - Impact of road surface conditions (e.g., dry, wet, icy) on accident frequency and severity.  
   - Identification of high-risk road conditions.  

6. **Casualties by Road Type**:  
   - Analysis of accidents by road type (e.g., highways, urban roads, rural roads).  
   - Comparison of accident rates and severity across different road types.  

7. **CY Casualties vs PY Casualties Monthly Trend**:  
   - Comparison of casualties in the current year (CY) versus the previous year (PY) on a monthly basis.  
   - Identification of trends, such as seasonal spikes or improvements in safety measures.
