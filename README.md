Car Accident Analysis Dashboard
Overview
This repository contains an analysis of car accident data using advanced Excel techniques to create interactive dashboards. The dataset used for this project is the Car Accident Dataset from Kaggle, which can be found here. The goal of this project is to provide insights into car accident trends, causes, and patterns using data visualization and Excel's powerful features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle:

Dataset Name: Car Accident Dataset

Source: Kaggle Dataset Link

Description: The dataset contains detailed information about car accidents, including location, time, weather conditions, vehicle types, and more. It provides a comprehensive view of factors contributing to accidents.

Tools Used
Microsoft Excel: Advanced Excel techniques were used to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.

Excel Features:

Pivot Tables: For summarizing and aggregating data.

Charts and Graphs: For visualizing trends and patterns.

Conditional Formatting: To highlight key insights.

Slicers and Timelines: For interactive filtering in dashboards.

Formulas and Functions: For calculations and data manipulation (e.g., VLOOKUP, IF, SUMIFS).

Key Features of the Dashboard
Interactive Filters:

Use slicers and timelines to filter data by date, location, weather conditions, and more.

Visualizations:

Bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to display accident trends, causes, and severity.

Key Metrics:

Total accidents, average severity, most common causes, and accident hotspots.

Dynamic Updates:

The dashboard updates automatically as filters are applied, providing real-time insights.

Insights
The analysis of the car accident dataset revealed several key insights, which are visualized in the interactive Excel dashboard. Below are the highlights:

Total Casualties by Vehicle Type:

Breakdown of casualties by different vehicle types (e.g., cars, motorcycles, trucks, buses).

Identification of vehicle types most frequently involved in accidents.

Fatal Casualties:

Analysis of accidents resulting in fatalities.

Trends and contributing factors (e.g., speeding, drunk driving, poor road conditions).

Serious Casualties:

Examination of accidents causing serious injuries.

Correlation with factors such as weather, road type, and time of day.

Casualties by Car:

Focus on accidents involving cars, including passenger vehicles and SUVs.

Insights into common causes and severity levels.

Casualties by Road Surface:

Impact of road surface conditions (e.g., dry, wet, icy) on accident frequency and severity.

Identification of high-risk road conditions.

Casualties by Road Type:

Analysis of accidents by road type (e.g., highways, urban roads, rural roads).

Comparison of accident rates and severity across different road types.

CY Casualties vs PY Casualties Monthly Trend:

Comparison of casualties in the current year (CY) versus the previous year (PY) on a monthly basis.

Identification of trends, such as seasonal spikes or improvements in safety measures.
